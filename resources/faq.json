        "q": "How did you get started doing this?",
        "a": "Shortly after Christmas 2016, I began watching other people's Christmas light displays on YouTube. I was intrigued by the technology behind them. I decided that I wanted to try something like this, so I started researching. I joined the Do It Yourself Christmas forums and found out as much as I could. Eventually, I found myself planning our first show, purchasing parts, building, and sequencing."

        "q": "What sequencing software do you use?",
        "a": "I use the open source light sequencing program <a href='http://xlights.org/' class='bold'>xLights</a>. Shout out to the awesome developers!"

        "q": "How do you have your own radio station?",
        "a": "We have a small FM transmitter set up to transmit the music from our show computer to your car radio, broadcasting on an open frequency. It only transmits a few hundred feet, so you have to actually be here to get reception. Technically it's our own radio station, but it's not widespread."

    "3": {
        "q": "How does it work?",
        "a": "Our light display is a combination of electronic components and software working together to run the show. We use \"pixel lights\" in our display. Each light's color and intensity are controlled individually, so the effect possibilites are endless. Check out our <a href=\"/how-it-works\"><b>how it works</b></a> page for more information!"
